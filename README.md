Moving Avatar in Turbo Assembler (TASM)

This project is a moving avatar program created using Turbo Assembler (TASM) with DOS GUI.
It focuses on pixel-level graphics, basic animation, and Assembly programming fundamentals, allowing the avatar to move across the screen.

Features:
-Draws a moving avatar using DOS graphics mode
-Pure x86 Assembly (TASM syntax)
-Demonstrates pixel plotting, animation routines, and basic movement
-Compatible with Turbo Assembler / Turbo Debugger GUI

How to Use This Project (Turbo Assembler GUI)-->

To run this moving avatar using Turbo Assembler GUI:

1️⃣ Install Turbo Assembler

Make sure you have Turbo Assembler (TASM) and Turbo Debugger (TD) installed.
If using Windows 10/11, you may need DOSBox or DOSBox-X to run it properly.

2️⃣ Open the Project in TASM IDE

Clone or download this repository.
Open Turbo Assembler GUI.
In the GUI, open main.asm (or your main source file).

3️⃣ Assemble and Link

In the GUI, select Assemble to compile the .ASM file.
Then select Link to generate the executable (.EXE).

4️⃣ Run the Program

Click Run (or press the shortcut in TASM GUI).
The avatar will move according to the programmed animation routines.

5️⃣ Optional: Debugging

Open Turbo Debugger (TD) from the GUI to step through the code.
This helps you understand how the avatar moves pixel by pixel.

6️⃣ Notes

This project includes movement/animation.
Make sure all .ASM and .INC files are in the same folder to avoid missing file errors.
Recommended graphics mode: 13h (320×200, 256 colors).

Learning Goals:

-Understanding real-mode graphics programming with animation
-Learning pixel plotting, movement, and color manipulation
-Practicing x86 Assembly programming with TASM
